### Instructions

# The way I thought about the task

I constructed unit tests using junit in gradle. 

0. Created Item class unit test for name and price.
1. Created Item class with name and price.
2. Encapsulated item class, as well as putting it in an ArrayList in Receipt class.
3. Created subtotal of Receipt.
4. Created Test for PriceBasket.
5. Created another class for the PriceBasket (discounted Receipt).
6. Add Offers using the get methods of Receipt Class.
7. Change prices to fit pounds and pennies.

I still need to refactor.
